# Wai Hin Tse - portfolio

## Project Description
This project showcases my journey through the world of design, starting with a carefully crafted portfolio that embodies my vision and skill set. From initial concept to execution, this portfolio is a testament to my creative process and capabilities.

## Challenges
Throughout this project, I encountered various challenges, notably in integrating HTML and CSS lessons into a cohesive design. Key hurdles included ensuring accessibility, effectively using images, and mastering DevTools for optimization.

## Lessons Learned
This experience was invaluable. Here are some key lessons I gained from this project:
HTML and CSS Lessons
Github: Leveraging version control via Git and GitHub greatly streamlined collaboration and project management.
Grid and Flex: Mastery of both Grid and Flex layouts empowered me to create responsive and visually engaging designs.
Grid Layout with Flex Components: Combining Grid layout for overall structure with Flex components for intricate elements allowed for a versatile and structured design approach.
Accessibility: Ensuring accessibility compliance was crucial for a user-friendly experience. Implementing ARIA roles, alt text for images, and semantic HTML enhanced accessibility.
Images and Dev Tools: Optimizing images and utilizing DevTools for performance enhancement and debugging significantly improved overall site performance.
Animation, Transition, and Transform: Utilizing CSS animations, transitions, and transforms added dynamism and interactivity to the design.
Complex Selectors, Pseudo-Elements, and Custom Properties: Leveraging complex selectors, pseudo-elements, and custom properties allowed for more refined styling and design control.
Pseudo Judo: Employing advanced pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements judiciously enhanced the UI/UX without cluttering the HTML.
SVGs and Bootstrap: Integrating SVGs and utilizing Bootstrap's responsive grid system streamlined design implementation and enhanced visual appeal.
